After creating two instances of Die, we roll the dice and calculate 
the sum of the two dice for each roll. The largest possible result (12) 
is the sum of the largest number on both dice, which we store in max_result . 
The smallest possible result (2) is the sum of the smallest number on both 
dice. When we analyze the results, we count the number of results for each 
value between 2 and max_result. (We could have used range(2, 13), but 
this would work only for two D6 dice. When modeling real-world situations, 
it’s best to write code that can easily model a variety of situations. This code 
allows us to simulate rolling a pair of dice with any number of sides.)
When creating the chart, we include the dtick key in the x_axis_config
dictionary. This setting controls the spacing between tick marks on 
the x-axis. Now that we have more bars on the histogram, Plotly’s default 


settings will only label some of the bars. The 'dtick': 1 setting tells Plotly to 
label every tick mark. We also update the title of the chart and change the 
output filename as well.
