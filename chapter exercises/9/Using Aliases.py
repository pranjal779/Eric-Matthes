As you saw in Chapter 8, aliases can be quite helpful when using modules
to organize your projectsâ€™ code. You can use aliases when importing classes
as well.
As an example, consider a program where you want to make a bunch
of electric cars. It might get tedious to type (and read) ElectricCar over and
over again. You can give ElectricCar an alias in the import statement:
-> from electric_car import ElectricCar as EC
Now you can use this alias whenever you want to make an electric car:
-> my_tesla = EC('tesla', 'roadster', 2019)
