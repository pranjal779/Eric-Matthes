this note just for my reference, skip this file

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears
at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the
spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and
destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet
appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits
the player’s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player
loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

    - A quick Recap
    - pg 286


in the page 276 I forgot to make changes
from the Piloting the ship
had to refactor the code
note that at 277 some more changes
278


for the 6th iteration [1/3/2023]
it gets a little wierd as I am doing the project after the semester 3
so a little continuity is lost on me
problem with alien_invasion.py files -> _fire_bullet() ... and all
ignored line 31 for line 32.
few more issues
no errors in bullets.py

added 2_02 which has code that lets the ship move around


1/11/2023
added folder 8
with working files
In future I might have to start scratch to avoid any time gap redundancy and confusion
page 289 now works
the only question here is
the pdf it is self.bullets.update() which was not working for me for some reason
and in the solution repo which I copied it is _update_bullets()

may be this is a mistake, or it is something that is changed later in the chapter.?.

very interesting detail in about the loop for the line 34 to 37 page 289.

page 290 explains it.

folder 9 chp 13: -  follows chapter 13
important notes pg 294
